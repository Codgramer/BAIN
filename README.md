# Project: Bayesian Analysis & Inference

This project aims to explore Bayesian statistics, a method that helps us use prior knowledge to understand data better. Dive into probabilistic programming, a new way to code with probability using libraries like PyMC and ArviZ. This will allow us to create advanced models that show complex relationships in our data. We also revisit familiar machine learning models like Linear Regression and Regression Trees from a probabilistic perspective. By thinking probabilistically, we can make better decisions when dealing with uncertainty. It teaches you how to apply Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming simply and practically.

### Assignment-1

This assignment begins with a simple probability experiment involving jelly beans and then extends to writing a Python function for computing probabilities in non-equally likely scenarios. Finally, it includes an exploration of Gaussian distributions using the PreliZ library, examining various probability functions and their representations.

### Assignment-2

This assignment delves into probabilistic modeling, Bayesian statistics, and Bayesian inference. It begins by examining a probabilistic model involving normal and half-normal distributions, focusing on identifying priors and likelihoods, and applying Bayes' theorem. Next, it tackles a classic coin-flipping problem, applying Bayes' theorem to find posterior probabilities given observed outcomes. Finally, it involves using PyMC to modify parameters of a Beta distribution and compare results.
